<h1>Our History</h1>
<hr>
<div class="txt1">
<p>Goldsmiths is a business with more than 230 years of tradition and experience. Our first showroom opened in Newcastle in 1778, and it&prime;s still trading today on the very same site.</p>
<p>There have been many notable achievements for Goldsmiths. We were the jewellers who made the Rugby League Trophy, and we were the UK&prime;s first appointed stockist of Rolex watches.</p>
<p>Today, Goldsmiths is the largest quality jeweller in the UK with showrooms in every major town and city from Aberdeen to Torquay, as well as five in Northern Ireland. We also operate the largest distribution network for Rolex, Cartier, Omega, Gucci and many other reputable watch brands.</p>
<p>Even though we&prime;re bigger, we still put our customers first and have the finest selection of diamond jewellery, jewellery brands and fashion and prestige watches in our showrooms. Leading brands include Rolex, Omega, TAG Heuer, Breitling and Canadian Ice.</p>
<p>It all comes down to one thing: we love what we do. Big or small, diamonds, gold, silver. We love it all and our team trained to help you find and keep safe items you&prime;ll treasure forever.</p>
<p>Please note that not every brand or item shown on the website is stocked in all showrooms. To avoid disappointment we recommend you use our <a href="html_images.asp" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"> showroom locator </a> to search for your nearest stockist of the brand you are particularly interested in.</p>
<p>If unsure you can contact the store directly to check before setting off or call our customer experience team on 8 747 817 37 90.</p>
<p>Our lines are open Monday to Friday, 8am - 6pm, and 9am - 5pm on bank holidays. Calls are charged at national rate.</p>
